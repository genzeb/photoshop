Script to Generate iOS Icons and Default Images
---------

There are two scripts in this repository that allows you to generate all (current as of iOS 7.0.3 version) app icons and all default images, for all iOS devices versions.

INSTALLATION

Installation is straightforward. Download the two scripts and place them in:

            Application > Adobe Photoshop ... > Presets > Scripts
            
Restart Photoshop.

HOW TO USE

1) First task is to generate a master icon or default PNG image. Icon file must be 1024x1024 or larger, default image must be 2048x2048, or larger. 
2) Start Photoshop and select the following from the menu bar: File > Scripts > Create iOS Default.jsx (or Create iOS Icons.jsx)
3) Photoshop will ask you to give it the corresponding image, then the folder to save outputs to. When file generation is done, Photoshop will notify you with an alert view.
